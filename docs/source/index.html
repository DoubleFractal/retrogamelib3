    <h3>About Retro Game Library</h3>
    Retro Game Library is a tool for creating NES and GameBoy style games with Python and PyGame. Our priority was keeping it as useful as possible, while still giving you most of PyGame's freedom. The most restricting parts are the button and display modules, but they are easy to use and essential to the library.
