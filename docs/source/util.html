    The util module is a set of functions for loading resources.
    
    <blockquote>
        <b>util.filepath(path)</b><br/>
        Takes a path, e.g. "path/to/file.txt", and converts its slashes to your system's using os.path.join. It's basically a quicker and easier version of os.path.join.
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <b>util.load_image(filename)</b><br/>
        Loads an image, and caches it. If it's already been loaded, then it will return the previously loaded image. <code>filename</code> should be a path to the image, e.g. <code>"data/image.png"</code> or <code>"data\image.png"</code>. Its slashes are converted to your system path's using the filename function.
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <b>util.play_sound(filename, volume=1.0)</b><br/>
        Plays a sound, and caches it. <code>volume</code> should be the volume of the sound, anything from 0.0 to 1.0. <code>filename</code> should again be a path to the file, which is ran through the filepath function.
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <b>util.play_music(filename, loop=0, volume=1.0)</b><br/>
        Plays a music file. If you want it to loop, set <code>loop</code> to -1. <code>volume</code> is the volume of the music, anything from 0.0 to 1.0. <code>filename</code> should again be a path to the file, which is ran through the filepath function.
