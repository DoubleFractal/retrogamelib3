    <h2>retrogamelib.camera</h2>
        The camera module includes a Camera class which can aid in scrolling games. The Camera can follow any object with a rect, and must be used
    when drawing objects as well in order to handle the scrolling properly.
    
    <blockquote>
        <b>camera.Camera(object)</b>
        <blockquote>
            <b>Camera(xwindow = 80, ywindow = 80, speed = 0.05)</b><br/>
            Initialise a new Camera object. <br />
            <code>xwindow, ywindow</code> The number of pixels away from the tracking object the camera should stay within. If <code>xwindow</code>
            and <code>ywindow</code> are equal to zero, the camera will always keep the character in the center of the screen.<br />
            <code>speed</code> This is the speed at which the camera catches up to it's target.
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
            <b>Camera.follow(target)</b><br />
            Sets the target which the camera will follow. <br />
            <code>target</code> The target to track. Must have a rect attribute.
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
            <b>Camera.update()</b><br/>
            Should be called once per frame to update where the camera is pointing.
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
            <b>Camera.translate(rect)</b> -> return pygame.rect.Rect<br/>
            Returns a new rect that is translated into the cameras viewports.  Should be used when drawing objects as the final position
            an object is drawn.
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
            <b>Camera.freeze(object)</b><br/>
            Tells the camera that <code>object</code> is blocking the camera's movement. Useful for a boss or a cutscene.
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
            <b>Camera.unfreeze(object)</b><br/>
            Tells the camera that <code>object</code> is no longer blocking the camera's movement.
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
            <b>Camera.center_at(pos)</b><br/>
            Points the camera at a specific point. If the camera is following a target, the target is cleared.
        </blockquote>
